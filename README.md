INSIGHT:
Since Iam very new to coding, creationg a website was really stressfull. But it really feels good to have finally completed it by the end of the semester. And to have learnt new things, To understand and implement few topics I had to go through some external tutorials and and study sites. But Iam happy with the outcome although there is many fields that can be improved. Especially while developing a button to the backgorund colour, I couldnt workout to make the button work. And I couldnt look further into it due to my lack of time.
